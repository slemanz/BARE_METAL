# 11. Fault Handling and Analysis

**What is a Fault?**  
A fault is an exception generated by the processor to indicate an error.

**Why Do Faults Happen?**  
- Faults can occur when programmers violate the design rules of the processor or when there are issues with the interfaces the processor interacts with.
- When a fault occurs, the internal processor registers are updated to record the type of fault, the address of the instruction where it happened, and if the related exception is enabled, the processor will call the exception handler.
- In the exception handler, programmers can implement code to report, resolve, or recover from the fault. 
- For example, if your code attempts to divide a number by zero, a divide-by-zero fault will be raised by the hardware, triggering the usage fault exception handler (if enabled). In this handler, you can decide how to handle the issue, such as terminating the task.
- Most faults occur when the programmer's code does not follow the processor's programming guidelines.

**Types of Fault Exceptions in Cortex-Mx Processors:**
- **Hard Fault Exception:** Enabled by default, with a non-configurable priority.
- **Usage Fault Exception:** Disabled by default, but the priority can be configured.
- **Memory Management Fault Exception:** Disabled by default, but the priority can be configured.
- **Bus Fault Exception:** Disabled by default, but the priority can be configured.

*Note: The hard fault exception can be disabled by using the FAULTMASK register.*
