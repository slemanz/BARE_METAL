# 1. Intro
## ARM Cortex-M Processors

The ARM Cortex-M series is one of the most widely used families in the embedded world. These 32-bit processors are renowned for their power efficiency, high performance, and user-friendly interrupt management, supporting up to 240 external interrupts. Their architecture is designed to meet the needs of diverse applications, from simple to complex ones.

## Processor Core, Processor, and Microcontroller

Understanding the distinction between a processor core, a processor, and a microcontroller is essential for navigating the embedded systems landscape:

1. **Processor Core**: This is the fundamental building block of a processor. It handles the execution of instructions and performs computations. The processor core consists of the arithmetic logic unit (ALU), control unit, and registers. 

2. **Processor**: A processor, often referred to as a central processing unit (CPU), is a complete unit that includes one or more processor cores along with additional components such as cache memory and buses. It is designed to execute complex instructions and manage data flow between various system components.

3. **Microcontroller**: A microcontroller is a compact integrated circuit designed to govern a specific operation in an embedded system. It typically includes a processor core, memory (both RAM and ROM), and various peripheral interfaces all on a single chip. Microcontrollers are optimized for performing dedicated tasks.
